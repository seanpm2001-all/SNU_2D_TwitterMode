# Truncate info

2 files from this project got their names truncated due to a long file path.

The GitHub path is `//Twitter_Mode/Graphics/Twitter-All-Brand-Resources/__MACOSX/Twitter All Brand Resources/Twitter Tweet Treatments/Twitter_TweetTreatment_TextOnlyOnImageOrVideoBackground/`

## Original names

The PSD file had the name `._Twitter_TweetTreatment_TextOnlyOnImageOrVideoBackground.psd` but I can't rename files on GitHub that are binary.

The EPS file had the name `._Twitter_TweetTreatment_TextOnlyOnImageOrVideoBackground.eps` but I can't rename files on GitHub that are binary
